## Introducing surimi.dev - Sass validation library!

I just published the first few versions of [surimi.dev](https://surimi.dev), a Sass validation library that helps you write better Sass code by providing easy ways to validate user input.

Initially, I built this with my theming libraries in mind, because I needed some way to validate user-defined maps against pre-defined schemas. I found a few libraries like [sass-door](https://github.com/CarcajadaArtificial/sass-door) and [sassy-validation](https://github.com/iamskok/sassy-validation?tab=readme-ov-file),
but they didn't allow me to validate maps and nested data the way I wanted to: I wanted to write schemas like in zod or yup.

Zod, a popular validation library for javascript/typescript, allows you to define schemas and validate data on them like this:

```ts
import { z } from "zod/v4";
 
const User = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
});
 
// some untrusted data...
const input = { /* stuff */ };
 
// the parsed result is validated and type safe!
const data = User.parse(input);
```

Sadly, you cannot do it quite this elegantly in Sass, because you cannot build functional factories like `.number().min(1).label("age")`. Also, while you can specify functions as part of maps like this:

```scss {1,3-5}
@use 'sass:meta';

@function something() {
  @return 42;
};

$map: (
  "something": meta.get-function("something"),
);
```
